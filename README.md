A C# side project I've been making for a friend. Its purpose is to track certain things regarding NPCs in Terraria as a Twitch extension. In order to do that, I've built a tModLoader mod that has a couple of items (as a random addition for fun), added a server whose purpose is to broadcast the infor to the extension, and a program that should track the information (NPCs/NPCScanner.cs). Not done yet. Note: PNG files in Items folder do not belong to me. They are copied from the Terraria website as a test and I've changed their names according to tMod's naming rules (see images_used.txt for the sources).
